    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Learning never ends, so I've recently begun studying Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Manual Testing. My
            exposure to technologies has led me to encounter tools such as Enterprise Architect, Visual Studio, Brackets,
            Oracle, MySQL, and others.

                Reading novels is something I will dedicate my free time to, and Colleen Hoover is the author I have a strong
                preference for. In addition, I enjoy painting. My hobbies teach me to be curious and multitask. Hello, I'm
                Archana S and I'm currently living in Bangalore. This is just a short summary of who I am.
